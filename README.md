## Favorite Movie
Ever since I was a kid, I used to love the movie, "Toy Story". 

I love this movie because I really loved the characters and how they evolved over the course of time as well as how they communicated with Andy, the boy who owns these toys.

## Learning Experiences
During July of this year, I took an online course for Spanish 3. Although it was an excruciating class, I was able to finish it off strong and pass the course with an A.
